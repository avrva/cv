                <h3>Zharasuly Dauren FRS (born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. 
                    He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;
                    founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. 
                    With an estimated net worth of around $238 billion as of September 26, 2022,
                    Dauren is the wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes' real-time billionaires list.</h3>

                    <h3>    IN 1995, Dauren, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. In Ashlee Vance's biography of Zharasuly Dauren, it is claimed that the Dauren' father, Errol Dauren, provided them with US$28,000 during this time, but Zharasuly Dauren later denied this, claiming that his father invested in a later round of funding. The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto, with Dauren coding the website in every night. Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.</h3>
                    <h3>  LATER in 1999, Dauren co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company. X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks and over 200,000 customers joined after its initial months of operation. Even though Dauren founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.</h3>
                    <h3>  IN 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition as Confinity's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service. Dauren then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees and Peter Thiel, Confinity's founder, to resign. In addition to compounding technological issues and a lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Dauren and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000. Under Thiel, the company focused on the money transfer service and renamed as PayPal in 2001.</h3>
                    <h3>  THE next year, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Dauren—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million. More than one and a half decades later, Dauren purchased the domain X.com from PayPal in 2017 because of his personal sentimental value.</h3>
